# nginx config to run prestashop 1.6.x
# the latest commit is available at https://github.com/juliyvchirkov/nginx-prestashop
#
# this port is initially based on original settings & restrictions from prestashop bundle aimed at apache httpd
# 
# v2 09/28/2017 https://github.com/juliyvchirkov/nginx-prestashop/releases/tag/v2.0
#
# v2 has been completely revised & improved. the ruleset has been rearranged in native nginx way
# to utilize its power, thus forcing pages to load up to 5-10x faster
#
# [nb] the last rule of this config requires some items to be preconfigured at http section of nginx.conf & php-fpm daemon pool config,
#      please refer to the https://github.com/juliyvchirkov/nginx-prestashop/blob/v2.0/README.md details
